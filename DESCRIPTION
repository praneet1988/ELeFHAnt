Description: Ensemble Learning for Harmonization and Annotation of Single Cells provides an easy to use interface for users to annotate clusters of single cells, harmonize cell labels across single cell datasets to generate a unified atlas and infer relationship among metadata of interest between two single cell datasets. It uses following classifiers in an ensemble: randomForest, Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression
